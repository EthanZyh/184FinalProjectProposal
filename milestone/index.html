        <h1>Summary</h1>
        
        <p>
            Our proposed project aims to implement the conversion from point cloud to mesh formats.
            By implementing this conversion process, we aim to enhance the flexibility and compatibility 
            of 3D object representation in various applications, enabling users to work with the format 
            that suits their needs best. We implement 
            <a href="https://vgc.poly.edu/~csilva/papers/tvcg99.pdf"> the paper</a>
            mentioned in the Final Project Idea.
        </p>
        
        
        
		<h1>Milestone</h1>
		<p>
			We firstly use the original mesh as input to generate a point cloud with vertex normals as the input of our algorithm, 
			which is shown in the following figures.
		</p>

		<div align="center">
			<table style="width:100%">
				<tr>
					<td align="middle">
						<img src="./images/input.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption align="middle">input mesh</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td align="middle">
						<img src="./images/input-pointcloud.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption align="middle">output point cloud</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>
			After that, we use the point cloud with vertex normals as input to reconstruct a mesh, 
			which is the most challenging part of this project. The simple idea is that we will use set a hyperparameter r
            as radius
			to construct a sphere, which will be "captured" by 3 points, and then we use these points to 
			form a triangular face. By rolling the sphere on the surface of the point cloud, we construct faces step by step.
            The following figure shows the result of different number of steps.
		</p>
		<div align="center">
			<table style="width:100%">
				<tr>
					<td align="middle">
						<img src="./images/2000-1.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption align="middle">2000 faces</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td align="middle">
						<img src="./images/4400.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption align="middle">4400 faces</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>
			Clearly, with more faces generated, the mesh will be more accurate. But we can  find even with 4400 steps where our algorithm converges, we still
			cannot get a perfect mesh. Compared with the original mesh, we can find that the main body, which is smoother and 
			more continuous, is more easy to reconstruct. While the small details, such as the ears or the feet, are more difficult to
			reconstruct.
		</p>
		<div align="center">
			<table style="width:100%">
				<tr>
					<td align="middle">
						<img src="./images/4400-tail.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption align="middle">main body</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td align="middle">
						<img src="./images/4400-ear-back.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption align="middle">ear part</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td align="middle">
						<img src="./images/4400-feet.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption align="middle">feet part</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>
			By analysis, we can find the following problems:
			<ol>
                <li>The number of faces generated matters, but we can't reconstruct the mesh accurately by simply adding
					more faces. We can compare the 4000 faces with 4400 faces. We can find that 4400 faces are more accurate,
					but the ear part is still not reconstructed well. 
				</li>
				<div align="center">
					<table style="width:100%">
						<tr>
							<td align="middle">
								<img src="./images/4000-1.png" width="400px" />
								<figcaption align="middle">4000 faces</figcaption>
							</td>
							<td align="middle">
								<img src="./images/4400.png" width="400px" />
								<figcaption align="middle">4400 faces</figcaption>
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</div>
				<li>The hyperparameter r is also important. We can find that if we set r too small, the sphere will be too small,
					the faces formed by the point will be small. If the points are sparse in some area, 
					the sphere is not captured and leads to a hole in the mesh.
					But if we set r too large, the sphere will be too large. Some sunkens are omitted (imagine a large tire 
                    rolling on uneven ground). 
				</li>
            </ol>
		</p>

        <h1>Plan</h1>
        <ol>
            <li> Find out why ears and feet do not seem decent. Our guess is about the conditions to create a triangle.  </li>
            <li> Use incresing r in different steps to fix the problem of constant r. </li>
            <li> Add some pre-processing to the input. The paper mentioned this but did not give details. </li>
            <li> Measure the result through some metrics. </li>
        </ol>
