        <h1> Abstract </h1>
        
        <p>
            Our proposed project aims to implement the conversion from point cloud to mesh format.
            Taking point cloud and vertex normals as input, we will reconstruct a mesh with the same 
            set of vertices and generated faces. Here the vertex normals point to the inside of the mesh.
            By implementing this conversion process, we aim to enhance the flexibility and compatibility 
            of 3D object representation in various applications, enabling users to work with the format 
            that suits their needs best. We implement the paper of 
            <a href="https://vgc.poly.edu/~csilva/papers/tvcg99.pdf"> Ball Pivoting Algorithm </a>
            mentioned in the Final Project Idea.
        </p>

        <h1>Milestone</h1>
		<p>
			We firstly use the original mesh as input to generate a point cloud with vertex normals as the input of our algorithm, 
			which is shown in the following figures.
		</p>

		<div align="center">
			<table style="width:100%">
				<tr>
					<td align="middle">

						<img src="./images/input-pointcloud.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption align="middle">output point cloud</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>
			After that, we use the point cloud with vertex normals as input to reconstruct a mesh, 
			which is the most challenging part of this project. The simple idea is that we will use set a hyperparameter r
            as radius
			to construct a sphere, which will be "captured" by 3 points, and then we use these points to 
			form a triangular face. 
			Each step by rolling the sphere on the surface of the point cloud, we possibly construct a face 
			(sometimes a face cannot be constructed due to unsatisfied conditions).
            The following figure shows the result of different number of steps.
		</p>

				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>
			Clearly, with more faces generated, the mesh will be more accurate. But we can  find even with 4400 steps where our algorithm converges, we still
			cannot get a perfect mesh. Compared with the original mesh, we can find that the main body, which is smoother and 
			more continuous, is more easy to reconstruct. While the small details, such as the ears or the feet, are more difficult to
			reconstruct.

        <h1> Final Technical approach </h1>
        <p>
            The algorithm follows from a simple idea: Imagine a ball rolling over the outer surface of the point cloud.
        </p>
        <strong><p> Seed triangle </p></strong>
        <p>
            A ball with a specific radius can be "captured" by three points, i.e. given the radius, we can 
            determine an only sphere (possibly not exist) on the outer surface that passes through these three points. 
            We call this sphere the "captured sphere" of these three points. 
            Suppose we find three points and their captured sphere, such that there is no other point in the 
            sphere, then we can construct a triangular face with these three points. We call this triangle a 
            "seed triangle". We regard seed triangles as part of the final mesh.
        </p>
        <strong><p> Expanding triangles </p></strong>
        <p>
            After we construct a seed triangle, we can expand it by rolling the ball on any edge (u,v) of the triangle
            on the outer surface of the point cloud. 
            When the ball hit another point w, we say that the ball is captured by the three points u, v, w. 
            And we construct a new triangle (u,v,w) and add it to the mesh. We call (u,v) the pivot edge.
            We maintain the edges that can be a pivot edge later in a fringe.
        </p>

        These are the two core steps of the algorithm. Here we give the pseudo code of the algorithm we implemented, 
        slightly different from the paper.
        <div align="center">
			<table style="width:100%">
				<tr>
					<td align="middle">
						<img src="./images/pseudo_code.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption align="middle"> Pseudo code of our Ball Pivoting Algorithm</figcaption>

		</div>

        Now we give more details about the algorithm.
        <strong><p> Radius List </p></strong>
        <p>
            It is obvious that the radius of the captured sphere is a key parameter of the algorithm.
            If the radius is too small, the ball is likely to fall through the holes of the point cloud instead
            of rolling on the outer surface. 
            If the radius is too large, in the limit case, infinitely large, the ball becomes a directed plane, 
            and the algorithm will generate the convex hull of the point cloud.
            Therefore, we begin with a relative small radius, and gradually increase it. 
            The smaller radius may result in many holes on the mesh, which can be filled later by larger radius.
        </p>

        <strong><p> Selection of seed triangle </p></strong>
        <p> 
            We use a simple strategy to select the seed triangle. 
            We first select a point p sequentially, and find all points within 2*r of p. 
            We call them the neighbors of p. 
            Then we select a neighbor q of p, and find all points within 2*r of q.
            We enumerate them as t, and find the captured sphere of p, q, t.
            If there is no other point in the sphere, we construct a seed triangle (p,q,t).
        </p>

        <strong><p> Spatial Queries </p></strong>
        <p>
            In selection of seed triangles we need to find all points within 2*r of a point.
            We use a grid data structure to accelerate this process.
            We divide the whole space into small cubes with side length 2*r.
            Then we can say that, the neighbors of a point p must be in the same cube as p, or in the 26 cubes 
            near p's cube.
            A hash table is used to map a coordinate to a cube.
            Note that we need to re-build this data structure when the radius changes.
        </p>

        <strong><p> Finding hit point in expanding triangles </p></strong>
        <p>
            When we expand a triangle (u,v,w) on edge (u,v), we simulate a ball rolling 
            on (u,v) and find the next hit point. Say the center of the captured sphere of 
            u, v, w is c.
        </p>
        <p>
            We first find all points within 2*r of u and v. 
            For each such point t, we find the captured sphere of u, v, t. 
            Say the center of the sphere is d. 
            We compute the dihedral angle c-(u,v)-d which we implement by hand.
            This angle is the angle that the ball will roll on (u,v) till it hits t.
            We select the point t with the smallest angle. 
            If the hit point t is not the same as w, we claim that the ball captured by u, v, t 
            contains no other point. Then we construct a new triangle (u,v,t) and add it to the mesh.
        </p>

        <strong><p> Computing the captured sphere </p></strong>
        <p>
            Given three points u, v, w and the radius r, 
            we need to find the center of the captured sphere.
        </p>
        <p>
            The distances between the center and the three points are all the same, which means 
            the center is on the line perpendicular to the plane (u,v,w) passing through the
            circumcenter of triangle (u,v,w).
            We can compute the circumcenter of (u,v,w) by formula.
            Then we can easily find the "height" of the center above the plane (u,v,w) by Pythagorean theorem.
            Finally we can find the center by the height and the circumcenter.
            In implementation we define every triangle to be directed, i.e. the three points are in clockwise order.
            The sphere must be ABOVE the plane (u,v,w).
        </p>
        
        <strong><p> Avoiding repeated triangles </p></strong>
        <p>
            Suppose u-v-w is part of the fringe, and we expand on edge (u,v) to hit point w,
            and then we expand on edge (v,w) to hit point u. 
            Then we will construct two triangles (u,v,w) and (v,w,u), which are the same.
            This is very likely to happen during the inner loop of the algorithm. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To avoid this, we use the half-edge structure taught in class.
            We maintain the map from each half-edge to its face. 
            When we expand on an edge, we check whether there is a face containing the halfedge.
            If there is, we skip the expansion.
        </p>
