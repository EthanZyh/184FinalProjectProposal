        <h1>Summary</h1>
        
        <p>
            Our proposed project aims to implement the conversion from point cloud to mesh formats.
            By implementing this conversion process, we aim to enhance the flexibility and compatibility 
            of 3D object representation in various applications, enabling users to work with the format 
            that suits their needs best. We implement 
            <a href="https://vgc.poly.edu/~csilva/papers/tvcg99.pdf"> the paper</a>
            mentioned in the Final Project Idea.
        </p>
        
        <h1>
            Problem Description
        </h1>
        <p>
            In computer graphics, a point cloud is a set of points in a 3D space, 
            while a mesh is a set of triangles. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The ability to convert between point cloud and mesh formats is essential 
            as certain applications require a specific format. 
            For example, point clouds are commonly used for capturing 3D data from real-world objects, 
            while meshes are often used for rendering and animation purposes. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Converting one format to the other requires a fundamental change in the data structure, 
            which can be complex and computationally expensive. 
            Besides, the conversion process may result in a loss of information or introduce artifacts,
            which is undesirable when we persue an equivalent conversion.
        </p>
        <p>
            To achieve this goal, we plan to implement an existing algorithm that can accurately 
            convert between point cloud and mesh formats. Specifically, we plan to implement 
            <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/hoppe/poissonrecon.pdf"> the more challenging paper</a>
            mentioned in the Final Project Idea.
        </p>
        
        <h2 align="middle">Goals and Deliverables</h2>
        <p>
            We plan to develop a robust and efficient algorithm for converting point cloud to mesh and 
            mesh to point cloud formats. The algorithm should be accurate and reliable. We plan to use 
            Python to implement it to fully utilize the computational resources in an easy way.
            Another goal is to reduce data loss and introduce minimal artifacts during the conversion process. 
            The converted data should maintain its original quality, including texture, curvature, 
            and features, as much as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            At last, optimize the conversion process to improve its performance and 
            reduce computational complexity. 
            This optimization should be achieved through techniques such as 
            surface reconstruction and mesh simplification, minimizing the 
            loss of data and improving the quality of the output.
        </p>
        <p>
            To measure the performance, we will compute: Hausdorff distance between our result and the reference data,
            running time, and scalability of our algorithm by measuring its performance on datasets of varying sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will document the algorithm development process, including the research, 
            implementation, optimization, and evaluation, in a report or paper. 
            The documentation will enable others to understand and replicate our work.
        </p>
        
		<h1>Milestone</h1>
		<p>
			We firstly use the original mesh as input to generate a point cloud with vertex normals as the input of our algorithm, 
			which is shown in the following figures.
		</p>

		<div align="center">
			<table style="width:100%">
				<tr>
					<td align="middle">
						<img src="./images/input.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption align="middle">input mesh</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td align="middle">
						<img src="./images/input-pointcloud.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption align="middle">output point cloud</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>
			After that, we use the point cloud with vertex normals as input to reconstruct a mesh, 
			which is the most challenging part of this project. The simple idea is that we will use set a hyperparameter r
            as radius
			to construct a sphere, which will be "captured" by 3 points, and then we use these points to 
			form a triangular face. 
			Each step by rolling the sphere on the surface of the point cloud, we possibly construct a face 
			(sometimes a face cannot be constructed due to unsatisfied conditions).
            The following figure shows the result of different number of steps.
		</p>
		<div align="center">
			<table style="width:100%">
				<tr>
					<td align="middle">
						<img src="./images/2000-1.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption align="middle">2000 steps</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td align="middle">
						<img src="./images/4400.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption align="middle">4400 steps</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>
			Clearly, with more faces generated, the mesh will be more accurate. But we can  find even with 4400 steps where our algorithm converges, we still
			cannot get a perfect mesh. Compared with the original mesh, we can find that the main body, which is smoother and 
			more continuous, is more easy to reconstruct. While the small details, such as the ears or the feet, are more difficult to
			reconstruct.
		</p>
		<div align="center">
			<table style="width:100%">
				<tr>
					<td align="middle">
						<img src="./images/4400-tail.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption align="middle">main body</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td align="middle">
						<img src="./images/4400-ear-back.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption align="middle">ear part</figcaption>
					</td>
					<td align="middle">
						<img src="./images/4400-feet.png" width="400px" />
						<figcaption align="middle">feet part</figcaption>
					</td>
				</tr>
			</table>
		</div>
		<p>
			By analysis, we can find the following problems:
			<ol>
                <li>The number of steps matters, but we can't reconstruct the mesh accurately by simply adding
					more steps. We can compare the 4000 steps with 4400 steps. We can find that 4400 steps are more accurate,
					but the ear part is still not reconstructed well. 
				</li>
				<div align="center">
					<table style="width:100%">
						<tr>
							<td align="middle">
								<img src="./images/4000-1.png" width="400px" />
								<figcaption align="middle">4000 steps</figcaption>
							</td>
							<td align="middle">
								<img src="./images/4400.png" width="400px" />
								<figcaption align="middle">4400 steps</figcaption>
							</td>
						</tr>
					</table>
				</div>
				<li>The hyperparameter r is also important. We can find that if we set r too small, the sphere will be too small,
					the faces formed by the point will be small. If the points are sparse in some area, 
					the sphere is not captured and leads to a hole in the mesh.
					But if we set r too large, the sphere will be too large. Some sunkens are omitted (imagine a large tire 
                    rolling on uneven ground). 
				</li>
            </ol>
		</p>

        <h1>Plan</h1>
        <ol>
            <li> Find out why ears and feet do not seem decent. Our guess is about the conditions to create a triangle.  </li>
            <li> Use incresing r in different steps to fix the problem of constant r. </li>
            <li> Add some pre-processing to the input. The paper mentioned this but did not give details. </li>
            <li> Measure the result through some metrics. </li>
        </ol>
